# Algorithms
This project contains Python implementation of common algorithmic problems.

## Algorithms are written using Python and Matplotlib library

1. Sorting algorithms:
  * Bubble Sort
  * Quicksort
  * Selection Sort
  Run sorts.py file to generate output charts that show computation time of each algorithm.
  
2. Trees:
  * Binary Search Tree
  * AVL Tree
  Open tree_test.py to generate output charts.

3. Heaps:
  * Binary Heap
  * Ternary Heap
  * Quaternary Heap
  Run test_heaps.py to compare these heaps.
    
4. Pattern Search:
  * Naive Algorithm
  * Boyer-Moore Algorithm
  Run test_algorithms.py to generate output and compare these two algorithms.
  
5. Implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
